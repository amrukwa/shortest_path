By default, the program will try to read 'data.txt' file from current directory.
Use --help command to get help on the program usage.
Use --input= command, location and the name of the file to run the program on it: --input=location\data.txt
If something is wrong with the file you specified, you will be given opportunity to fix this.
You can encounter the following messages during the program execution:
1. This message: it will show you all the other messages that can be displayed, as well as the commands that can be used by you.
2. "No such file in chosen directory." - it means exactly that. The directory and the file you provided could not be found or you did not specify any and the program have not found the default file.
3. "Unknown command" - you provided the command that could not be processed.
4. "The edge should have positive value. Specify the correct length." accompanied by the names od the points - you gave 0 for the edge length. Provide actual value for the edge between these points.
5. "Invalid edge. Specify the correct length." - you gave character for the edge length or gave a point with two part name and no edge. You can only specify the edge length here.
6. "Invalid edge format." - after program request for the correct edge length you provided 0 or character instead of positive value.
7. "... was provided. Specify the actual edge." - the input line was lacking/you provided too much. You should specify it again: start_point end_point distance
8. "Choose the starting/ending point:" - the program could not find the start and end points in the last line of the input, so you should provide them manually.
9. "No such node." - the point you provided is not in the graph.
10. "There is no path." - the program did not find the connection between specified points.
11. "There is a path!" - the program found the connection you asked for.
12. "Failed to create file." - the file with the exact path could not be created.
